Distance Sensing Comparison Between Two Sensors Using a Model Car

Our project aims to compare distance readings from the ultrasonic sensor with an infrared sensor. An ultrasonic sensor is a sensor that depends on the emission and receives sound waves. To measure distance, it works by emitting a frequency that humans cannot hear and begins to count the time it takes for that signal to reach back to the receiver. Unlike the ultrasound sensor, the infrared sensor works by emitting infrared waves and then measuring the intensity of the light it receives after it bounces back from the surface. This light intensity must then be converted to tell the distance between the sensor and the surface. Our null hypothesis is that the average distance measured from the ultrasonic sensor with the model car would be equal to the average distance measured from the infrared sensor. The alternative hypothesis is that the average distances would not be identical. Our significance level was set to 0.05.
